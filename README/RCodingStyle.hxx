// This file demonstrates the coding styles to be used for new ROOT files.
// See the accompanying source file for context.

// File names correspond to the name of the main class that they contain.
// Our users will expect that a file called "RCodingStyle.hxx" contains a class
// named `RCodingStyle`.

// All files start with a Doxygen header, followed by the copyright statement.
// The "-year" part is kept up to date by a script.

// The file must contain no trailing whitespace including no indentation-only lines.
// Except for extreme cases, line breaks should happen between 80 and 120 characters.

// The first non-comment, non-empty line must be the #include guard.
// Acceptable forms are:
//   ROOT_RCodingStyle, ROOT_RCodingStyle_hxx, ROOT_RCodingStyle_Hxx,
//   ROOT_RCODINGSTYLE, ROOT_RCODINGSTYLE_HXX
// The first is preferred.
#ifndef ROOT_RCodingStyle

// Especially within header files, using forward declarations instead of
// including the relevant headers wherever possible.
// EXCEPTION: standard library classes must be #included, not forward declared.
// All files must be stand-alone: all types must be available through a
// forward declaration or an #include; it is not acceptable to rely on an
// included header to itself include another header needed by the file.

// Include ROOT's headers first, in alphabetical order:
//   Rationale: make sure that ROOT headers are standalone.
// Do not use #include guards at the point of `#include`.
//   Rationale: compilers optimize this themselves, this is interfering with their optimization.
// Use <>, not "".
//   Rationale: "" looks at ./ first; as ROOT headers are included by user code
//   that adds context fragility.
#include <ROOT/TSeq.hxx>
// Include v6 ROOT headers last.
// You're welcome to state what's used from a header, i.e. why it's included.
#include <Rtypes.h> // for ULong64_t

// Now include other C++ headers hat are not from the stdlib:
// e.g. #include <cppyy/CPpYy.h>

// Include stdlib headers next, in alphabetical order.
#include <string>

// Include C headers last.
// Rationale: non-ROOT, non-stdlib headers often #define like mad. Reduce interference
// with ROOT or stdlib headers.
#include <curses.h>

// Say NO to
// - `using namespace` in at global scope in headers
// - variables, types, functions etc at global scope
// - preprocessor `#define`s except for #include guards (and are cases where
//   `#include`d headers require them)
